I am an experimental particle physicist. Primarily, I work on the CMS experiment which is located along the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. My work involves the study of all sorts of physics that happens when you smash high-energy protons at the Large Hadron Collider. When high-energy protons collide at the Large Hadron Collider, they create more particles. These particles have various quantifiable properties which are then converted into datasets, and these datasets can help us discover new physics about our universe.

|The figure shows the improvement of the distribution of the electron-positron pair mass from Z boson decays, recorded in the forward electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS. The distribution before corrections is shown in red (i.e. right after the clustering algorithm) and the final distribution in blue after all the corrections (including machine learning and detector response equalisation).|An electron (and its bremsstrahlung photons) passing through the tracker and creating clusters of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).|

I am currently a research associate working for the Institute of High Energy Physics (Chinese Academy of Sciences), and I am based out of CERN Meyrin campus. A typical day in my life would involve studying the distributions of particle kinematics of the collision products. It is then followed by creating new tools for converting the collision data into more interesting plots that can give us insight into the physics of the particles. I am also extremely interested in exploiting machine learning based tools/algorithms/strategies to help unravel mysteries of the universe by analyzing large datasets of collision data.
