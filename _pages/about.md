My work involves the study of all sorts of physics that happens when you smash high-energy protons at the Large Hadron Collider. I live in France, work in Switzerland and I love what I do. A typical day in my life would probably involve lots of coding, creating new tools for converting data into interesting plots, and then zooming in and out of those plots on a laptop screen. If I like the plots, I like to add some time factor into them to create gifs and then stare at the now created time evolution. You see, numbers when converted into plots are a cool time pass.

On a bit more technical side, I am interested in developing tools/algorithms/strategies that help unravel mysteries of the universe by analyzing large datasets of high-energy particle collision data. Basically, when high-energy protons collide at the Large Hadron Collider, they create more particles. These particles have various quantifiable properties which are then converted into datasets, and sometimes these datasets can help us discover new physics about our universe.
