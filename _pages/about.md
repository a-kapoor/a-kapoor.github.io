I am an experimental particle physicist. Primarily, I work on the [CMS](https://cms.cern/) experiment which is located along the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](https://home.cern/). I am currently a research associate working for the Institute of High Energy Physics (Chinese Academy of Sciences), and I am based out of the CERN Meyrin campus. I also serve as a Level-2 co-convener in E/Gamma POG [E/Gamma physics object group](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/EgammaPOG). The E/Gamma group is responsible for the review and recommendation of proper electron and photon object usage in the CMS collaboration. This also requires the development of several tools that help physicists in the collaboration implement and apply proper identification, correction, and calibration criteria.

My work involves the study of all sorts of physics that happens when you smash high-energy protons at the Large Hadron Collider. When high-energy protons collide at the Large Hadron Collider, they create more particles. These particles are then detected by the CMS detector. This helps us measure the various properties of these particles. Then begins the process of slicing and dicing of the collision data to draw physics insights to better understand the fundamental workings of our universe.

|The figure shows the improvement of the distribution of the electron-positron pair mass from Z boson decays, recorded in the forward electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS. The distribution before corrections is shown in red (i.e. right after the clustering algorithm) and the final distribution in blue after all the corrections (including machine learning and detector response equalisation).|An electron (and its bremsstrahlung photons) passing through the tracker and creating clusters of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).|

 A typical day in my life would involve studying the distributions of particle kinematics of the collision products. It is then followed by creating new tools for converting the collision data into more interesting plots that can give us insight into the physics of the particles. I am also extremely interested in exploiting machine learning based tools/algorithms/strategies to help unravel mysteries of the universe by analyzing large datasets of collision data.
